                        For centuries, the history of Vietnam has been told through battles and borders, 
                        victories and losses — yet rarely through the women who sustained it all. They fought 
                        beside men, led armies, nursed the wounded, and carried messages through jungles. 
                        Many never returned home. Their courage was not written in marble statues or schoolbooks, 
                        but whispered through generations of mothers and daughters.

                        of the nation's endurance. To look at Vietnam's past through the eyes of its women is 
                        to see a different kind of heroism — not the triumph of power, but of persistence. 
                        These women resisted not only foreign armies, but also the quiet erasure of their names from history.

                        Long before the word feminism existed, Vietnam's first revolution was led by women.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 40 A.D., Trưng Trắc and Trưng Nhị — two sisters from Mê Linh — rose against the Han dynasty, 
                        commanding thousands to reclaim independence. Riding elephants draped in silk banners, 
                        they turned grief into rebellion after the execution of Trưng Trắc's husband.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Their uprising lasted only three years, but it lit a torch that would never go out. 
                        Through five stories across centuries, you will meet the women who rebelled, resisted, 
                        and rebuilt — each carrying the same spirit of defiance and care.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-column">
                    <p>
                        Centuries later, Lady Triệu of Thanh Hóa rejected royal submission, vowing to fight 
                        rather than "live as a slave to men." She led her troops wearing yellow robes and 
                        rode into battle on an elephant, her courage echoing across centuries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These women were not simply warriors — they were the first to prove that leadership 
                        in Vietnam could wear the face of a woman. In every uprising that followed, their 
                        names became both war cry and prayer, their courage folded into the soul of the nation. 
                        Their legacy was not victory, but the permission to rise.

                            <h3>The Trưng Sisters</h3>
                            <p>
                                In 40 A.D., Trưng Trắc and Trưng Nhị led the first major Vietnamese uprising against 
                                Chinese domination. After the execution of Trưng Trắc's husband Thi Sách, the sisters 
                                gathered forces and led a rebellion that briefly established an independent Vietnamese state.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Trưng sisters mobilized an army of 80,000 fighters, both men and women, and successfully 
                                liberated 65 citadels. They rode elephants into battle, draped in silk banners, turning their 
                                personal grief into a national revolution. Though their rebellion was eventually crushed by 
                                the Han general Ma Yuan in 43 A.D., they became eternal symbols of resistance and independence.

                            <h3>Lady Triệu (Triệu Thị Trinh)</h3>
                            <p>
                                Born in 225 A.D. in Thanh Hóa, Lady Triệu (Triệu Thị Trinh) became a legendary warrior 
                                who led a rebellion against Chinese rule in 248 A.D. At just 23 years old, she rejected 
                                the traditional role of a woman and vowed to fight rather than "live as a slave to men."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                She led her troops wearing yellow robes, riding into battle on an elephant, her courage 
                                inspiring thousands. Her famous declaration — "I want to ride the storm, and slay the whale 
                                in the sea" — became a symbol of Vietnamese resistance. Though her rebellion was eventually 
                                crushed, her words survived longer than any empire, echoing through centuries as a testament 
                                to the indomitable spirit of Vietnamese women.
                            </p>

                        At seventeen, Võ Thị Sáu faced her executioners without a blindfold. 
                        The colonial soldiers offered her one last chance to plead for life — 
                        <span class="highlight-text">she smiled instead.</span>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The shots that ended her life could not silence her name; they echoed into every village, 
                    every generation that learned courage from a child. To this day, flowers are still placed 
                    at her grave in Côn Đảo — not as ritual, but as remembrance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Years later, Nguyễn Thị Định — known as the "Long-Haired General" — led thousands of unarmed 
                    women in the Đồng Khởi movement. They confronted armed soldiers with songs, flags, and bare hands, 
                    proving that resistance could be both fierce and tender.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both women stood against systems that sought to define them by fragility. They turned compassion 
                    into strength, endurance into strategy. To fight, for them, was not an act of anger but of care — 
                    care for the children who might live if they did not.

                            Not every heroine held a weapon. In the shadows of history were the women who cooked, carried, 
                            mended, and prayed — the silent backbone of every front line.

                            The youth volunteers of Trường Sơn carried ammunition through monsoon storms, patched uniforms 
                            by candlelight, and buried their friends beside unfinished roads. They were nurses, builders, 
                            and teachers all at once.

                            One photograph shows them laughing beside a broken truck, hair covered in dust. Their joy was an 
                            act of resistance; their endurance, a kind of victory. When bombs fell, they sang to steady their 
                            hands. When bridges collapsed, they built again.

                            These women may never have seen medals or monuments, yet every road that crosses Vietnam today bears 
                            their fingerprints. Theirs was a quiet revolution, fought with rice, cloth, and love.

                            Their legacy lives on — not in battlefields, but in classrooms, hospitals, and community halls. 
                            The spirit of the heroines continues through every Vietnamese woman who leads, teaches, heals, and dares to speak.

                            In Hanoi, a journalist challenges gender stereotypes on national television. In Đà Nẵng, a teacher 
                            rebuilds a rural school destroyed by floods. In Melbourne, a Vietnamese-Australian scientist leads a 
                            team developing renewable energy.

                            To remember them is to recognise ourselves. When we tell their stories, we are not looking backward but 
                            forward — reminding ourselves that the same fire still burns quietly inside us. The women of Vietnam remind 
                            us that history is not a book of wars, but a record of compassion. Their legacy is alive not in statues, 
                            but in every woman who refuses to give up — who holds her ground with kindness, and turns care into courage.
